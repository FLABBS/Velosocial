# Velosocial Telegram Bot

This bot provides a minimal social network for cyclists. Users can:

- Share their location and see nearby riders within 5 km.
- Create events with a route, date and optional group chat link.
- Maintain a short profile with a description and contacts.

Data is stored in a local JSON file (`data.json`). See `bot.py` for details.
